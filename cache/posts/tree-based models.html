<li><p>With Linear Regression we need to create new features to represent the <strong>features interactions</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Feature interactions occurs when the effects of features are combined</p>
</li>
<li><p>For example, the <strong>multiplication of two features</strong> can have more predictive power on the target than the individual features</p>
</li>
<li><p>With linear models, features must be <strong>linearly correlated</strong> (having non-zero correlation) to the target`.</p>
</li>
<li>Trees learn the <strong>non-linear interactions</strong> between the features and the target</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>For example, what if the $target$ goes up when</p>
<ul>
<li>the $feature1$ is going up, and </li>
<li>the $feature2$ is going down? </li>
<li>The only way to capture those interactions is to either <strong>multiply</strong> the features, or to use algorithms (like trees) that can handle non-linearity.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Linear regression is parametric i.e we don't keep the training data after we get the model parameters (like <strong>w</strong> (weights), <strong>b</strong> (intercepts))</p>
</li>
<li><p>Parametric and nonparametric models differ in the way parameters of the model are fixed or data needed each time to get determine the parameters</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trees are considered as non-parametric models.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trees partitions the features space horizontally or vertically thus they create axis-parallel hyper rectangles whereas linear models can divide the space in any direction or orientation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is a direct consequence of the fact that trees select a single feature at a time whereas linear models use a weighted combination of all features.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In principle, a tree can cut up the instance space arbitrarily finely into very small regions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A linear model places only a single decision surface through the entire space. It has freedom in the orientation of the surface, but it is limited to a single division into two segments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is a direct consequence of there being a single (linear) equation that uses all of the variables, and must fit the entire data space</p>

<li>Simple to interpret.</li>

<li>Requires little data preparation. </li>
<li>Other techniques often require <ul>
<li>data normalization, </li>
<li>dummy variables need to be created </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is <strong>logarithmic</strong> in the number of data points used to train the tree.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Able to handle both numerical and categorical data (Sklearn only support numerical data at the moment)</p>
</li>
<li>They can find non-linear relationships between features and target variables, as well as interactions between features. </li>
<li><p><strong>Quadratic, exponential, cyclical</strong>, and other relationships can all be revealed, as long as we have enough data to support all of the necessary cuts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Decision trees can also find <strong>non-smooth behaviors</strong>, sudden jumps, and peaks, that other models like linear regression or artificial neural networks can hide.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Decision tree can easily identify the most important(predictive) feautes and relation between two or more features.</p>
</li>
<li>With the help of decision trees, we can create new features that has better power to predict target variable. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Disadvantages-of-Decision-Trees-:">Disadvantages of Decision Trees :<a class="anchor-link" href="#Disadvantages-of-Decision-Trees-:">&#182;</a></h2><ul>
<li>Decision-tree learners can create <strong>over-complex trees</strong> that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting. </li>
<li>Setting constraints such as<ul>
<li>the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or</li>
<li>the maximum depth of the tree and</li>
<li>pruning (not currently supported by Sklearn) are necessary to avoid this problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an <strong>ensemble</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to <strong>balance the dataset</strong> prior to fitting with the decision tree.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the <strong>greedy algorithm</strong> where <strong>locally optimal decisions</strong> are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the <strong>features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In principle, you can approximate anything with decision trees but in practice you cant approximate very well. Still decision trees are very efficient because in practice the feature spaces are high dimensional that is data is very sparse</p>

<li><p>Trees start testing features from the ones that potentially most quickly lead to a conclusion i.e most predictive or important</p>
</li>
<li><p>In each node we test a feature</p>
</li>
<li>Order of features matters</li>
<li><p>In a step, for each feature the loss function (accuracy in case of classification) on the target variables calculated and the feature who provide the least loss is selected as the split feature</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the features are continuous, like temperature in our example, internal nodes may test the value against a <strong>treshold</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Everytime tree ask <code>Feature1&gt;=something</code> or <code>Feature2&gt;=something</code> results in two splits of the feature space horizontally or vertically</p>
</li>
<li><p>Decision trees are nested if-then staments</p>
</li>
<li><p>They predict the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the features.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For instance, in our dataset, decision trees learn from data with a set of <strong>if-then-else decision rules</strong> like if the <code>"hour"</code> is later than 5h and earlier than 6h else if <code>temperature</code> is higher than 15C then..</p>
</li>
<li><p>The deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the fitter the model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Steps-of-Splitting-Process">Steps of Splitting Process<a class="anchor-link" href="#Steps-of-Splitting-Process">&#182;</a></h2><p>Lets denote our features (like <code>temperature, humidity</code> etc) as $X_1, X_2,...,X_p$</p>
<p>For the split process there are 2 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We divide the feature space (the set of possible values for features) into <strong>J</strong> distinct and non-overlapping regions: $R_1, R_2,...,R_J$</p>
</li>
<li><p>When we make any prediction for a sample, we check in which region(subset) our sample falls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Say it is the region $R_j$. </li>
<li>Then the <strong>mean</strong> of the target values of the training samples in $R_j$ will be the predicted value of the given sample.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, suppose that</p>
<ul>
<li>in Step 1 we obtain 2 regions, $R_1$ and $R_2$, and </li>
<li>target mean of the training samples in the first region is <code>10</code>, while </li>
<li>target mean of the training samples in the second region is <code>20</code>. </li>
<li>Then, if a new sample is in $R_1$, we will predict a value of <code>10</code> for the target value of that sample, and if it in $R_2$ we will predict a value of <code>20</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="How-do-we-construct-the-regions-$R1,...,RJ-$-?">How do we construct the regions $R1,...,RJ $ ?<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-do-we-construct-the-regions-$R1,...,RJ-$-?">&#182;</a></h3><p>We divide the space into high-dimensional rectangles, or boxes. The goal is to find boxes $R_1,...,R_J$ that minimize the</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean Squared Error</strong>, which minimizes the <strong>L2 error</strong> using <strong>mean</strong> values of the regions, or </li>
<li><strong>Mean Absolute Error</strong>, which minimizes the <strong>L1 error</strong> using <strong>median</strong> values of the regions</li>

<p>where $ŶR_j$ is the target mean for the training observations within the $j th$ box and the <strong>$Y_i$</strong> is the actual target value of the test observation</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As seen above, regression tree split depends on the mean of the targets, since the mean is severly affected by outliers, the regression tree will suffer from outliers. <br></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are two main approaches to solve this problem: <ul>
<li>either removing the outliers or </li>

<p>The recursive binary splitting approach is top-down because</p>
<ul>
<li>it begins at the top of the tree (at which <strong>point all observations belong to a single region</strong>) and then </li>
<li>successively splits the features space; each split is indicated via 2 new branches further down on the tree. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is greedy because</p>

<ul>
<li>we first select the feature $X_j$ (jth feature) and the cutpoint $s$ such that splitting the feature space into two regions  where $X_j&lt; s$  and $X_j≥s$ leads to the greatest possible reduction in Mean Squared Error. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That is, we consider <strong>all features</strong> $X_1,...,X_p$, and <strong>all possible values of the cutpoint</strong> $s$ for each of the features, and then </li>

</ul>
<p>In greater detail,</p>

<li>$ŶR_2$ is the target mean for the training observations in $R_2(j, s)$. </li>
</ul>
<p>Finding the values of $j$ and $s$ can be done quite quickly, especially when the number of features is not too large.</p>
<p>Next, we repeat the process,</p>

<li><p>However, this time, instead of splitting the entire features space, we split one of the two previously identified regions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We now have 3 regions.</p>

<p>Again,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>we look to split one of these 3 regions further, so as to minimize the mean squared error.</p>
</li>
